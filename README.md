## think of clean project trees files, folders:
so its very recomended best practice is to put all your imgs into on folder and name it imgs or assets
and make sure to refrence the img src correctly 
## it seems you have repeated yorself a lot with `&nbsp;`
you can avoid this by adding margin to your tags,
e.g, to move your logo to the right a little bit, you can use `style="margin-left:50px"` this will push your tag 50px fro the  left edge of the screen
and similarly to any tag, also you can use `margin-top, margin-botton, margin-right` see doc about margin https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp
make use to try yourself in the link

## improvment
replace the h2 tag in line <h2> with <ul> and then wrap your a tag with <li>, you might notice that the font will be smaller, you can add style e.g `font-size: 20px` or x px
## Typo

thanks
